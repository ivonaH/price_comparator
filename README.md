## Running
Navigate to example1 project and run lein run.
To start a web server for the application navigate to example1 project and run:

    lein ring server

## Scraping data before running server
Before starting server, if you want to scrape perfume store website you should execute line 101 in file productsscraping.clj. That function creates db, inserts stores to db, scrapes data from defined stores and saves that products to db. If you want to use existing db, which is data scraped on 24.03.2021 just use existing database - database.db.
